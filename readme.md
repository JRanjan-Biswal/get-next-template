## ‚ú® Next.js Template Generator ‚ú®

Tired of setting up the same dependencies for every new Next.js project? Meet **`get-next-template`**, a powerful CLI tool that helps you scaffold a new Next.js application with your preferred configurations in seconds. It's the fastest way to get your project up and running, so you can focus on building great things\!

-----

### üöÄ Get Started

To begin, simply run the following command in your terminal. **Note:** For the best experience on Windows, we recommend using Git Bash.

```bash
npx get-next-template@latest <your-app-name>
```

Replace `<your-app-name>` with the name of your new project directory. The tool will then guide you through a series of interactive prompts.
